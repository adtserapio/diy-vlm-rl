The second panel appears to be a higher magnification view of the whisker pattern, while the third panel shows a more detailed view of individual whiskers.\n\nIn the second panel, the whiskers appear to be more densely packed and have a more complex structure compared to the first panel. This suggests that the second panel is showing a closer view of the whisker pattern, possibly focusing on specific regions where stimulation might occur.\n\nThe third panel provides an even more detailed view, showing individual whiskers with their orientation and position. This level of detail indicates that it is likely showing the most specific areas of the whisker pattern that could be stimulated.\n\nGiven this analysis, the second and third panels likely focus on different parts of the whisker pattern, with the second panel showing a more general view and the third panel showing a more detailed, specific view.\n\nConsidering the options provided, the most logical choice would be one that aligns with the detailed nature of the third panel and the general nature of the second panel.\n\n<answer>B</answer>",
